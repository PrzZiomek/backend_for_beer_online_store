# backend_for_beer_online_store
Back-end of my Beer Online Store app created as Node.js application connected with MySQL database. The server side is written by myself in TypeScript with Express.js. The project is it an early stage, the server gets registrated users data and then keeps in the database. Finally the server side will handle users data flow, users accounts, history of orders and so forth.
